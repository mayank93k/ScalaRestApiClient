A simple Scala project demonstrating how to make HTTP requests (GET and POST) to RESTful APIs using Java's HttpURLConnection. 
This project provides a practical example of handling API responses, including parsing JSON data, error handling, and managing timeouts. 
It's designed to help developers get started with Scala-based HTTP clients for interacting with web services.
